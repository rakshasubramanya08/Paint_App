## 🎨 Paint App
The project was referenced from [Project Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/paint-app-using-reactjs/).
This is a lightweight, browser-based drawing application built with **React** and **Vite**. It lets users draw freehand on a canvas, select different colors, clear the canvas, and interact with a minimal UI — all in real-time. The project was built by referencing open-source implementations and is designed to showcase interactive frontend development skills. It is included in my portfolio and resume to demonstrate my proficiency with HTML5 canvas, component-based architecture, and React state management.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🖌️ **Canvas Drawing** – Users can draw freeform strokes on the canvas using the mouse.
- 🌈 **Color Picker** – Choose different stroke colors to draw with.
- 🧹 **Clear Button** – Wipe the canvas clean with a single click.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Feedback** – Instant updates as you draw, with no page reloads.
- 🧩 **Modular Code** – Uses reusable components (`Menu.jsx`, etc.) for maintainability.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** – Component-based architecture for UI.
- **Vite** – Fast bundler and dev server.
- **HTML5 Canvas** – Core for rendering drawings.
- **JavaScript / JSX** – Functional logic and interactivity.
- **CSS** – Styling and layout.

### 📌 Purpose

This app was developed as a personal learning project to explore canvas-based rendering and React event handling. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to build intuitive, responsive interfaces and manage interactive user input. The code and structure were inspired by open-source references but custom-built for hands-on experience.
